# OCSSD (Open-Channel Solid State Drives)

<p align = "justify">
A new class of SSDs has been developed known as Open-Channel SSDs. Open-Channel SSDs differ from a traditional SSD in that they expose the internal parallelism of the SSD to the host and allows it manage it. This allows Open-Channel SSDs to provide three properties to the host: I/O isolation, predictable latencies, and software-defined non-volatile memory. OCSSD is an excellent platform for addressing SSD shortcomings and managing trade-offs related to throughout, latency, power consumption and capacity.

## what did I do?

1. Study and explore the basic knowledge of OCSSD: structure, working principle, performance metrics and design indexes;
2. Study the structure and design of subsystem LightNVM in its Linux Kernel;
2. Emulate OCSSD based on the QEMU, build OCSSD+LightNVM platform and test the basic functions;
3. Think about how OCSDD and ISC can be effectively combined.

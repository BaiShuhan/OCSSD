# OCSSD (Open-Channel Solid State Drives)

<p align = "justify">
A new class of SSDs has been developed known as Open-Channel SSDs. Open-Channel SSDs differ from a traditional SSD in that they expose the internal parallelism of the SSD to the host and allows it manage it. This allows Open-Channel SSDs to provide three properties to the host: I/O isolation, predictable latencies, and software-defined non-volatile memory.

## what did I do?

1. I studied and explored the basic knowledge of OCSSD;
2. I emulated OCSSD based on the QEMU platform and tried to test the basic functions;
3. I thought about how OCSDD and ISC can be effectively combined.
